  <h1>Go Module Mirror, Index, and Checksum Database</h1>
  <p>The Go team is providing the following services run by Google: a module mirror for accelerating
    Go module downloads, an index for discovering new modules, and a global go.sum database for
    authenticating module content.</p>

  <p>Since Go 1.13, the go command by default downloads and authenticates modules using the Go
    module mirror and Go checksum database. See
    <a href="privacy">proxy.golang.org/privacy</a> for privacy information
    about these services and the
    <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#private-module-privacy">go command documentation</a>
    for configuration details including how to disable the use of these servers or use different
    ones. If you depend on non-public modules, see the
    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Configuration_for_downloading_non_public_code">documentation for configuring your environment</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Services</h2>
  <p><a href="https://proxy.golang.org"><strong>proxy.golang.org</strong></a> - a module mirror
    which implements the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol">module proxy protocol</a>.
    For users downloading large numbers of modules (e.g. for bulk static analysis), the mirror
    supports a non-standard header, <code>Disable-Module-Fetch: true</code> that instructs it to
    return only cached content. This will avoid slow downloads, at the cost of possibly missing some
    rarely-used modules.
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://sum.golang.org"><strong>sum.golang.org</strong></a> - an auditable checksum
    database which will be used by the go command to authenticate modules.
    Learn more in the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#checksum-database">go command documentation</a>.

  <p><a href="https://index.golang.org"><strong>index.golang.org</strong></a> - an index which
    serves a feed of new module versions that become available by proxy.golang.org. The feed
    can be viewed at <a href="https://index.golang.org/index">https://index.golang.org/index</a>.
    The feed is served as new line delimited JSON, providing the module path (as Path), the module
    version (as Version), and the time it was first cached by proxy.golang.org (as Timestamp). The
    list is sorted in chronological order. There are two optional parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>
        'since': the oldest allowable timestamp (RFC3339 format) for module versions in the returned list. Default
        is the beginning of time, e.g.
        <a href="https://index.golang.org/index?since=2019-04-10T19:08:52.997264Z">https://index.golang.org/index?since=2019-04-10T19:08:52.997264Z</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        'limit': the maximum length of the returned list. Default = 2000, Max = 2000, e.g.
        <a href="https://index.golang.org/index?limit=10">https://index.golang.org/index?limit=10</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you use the index to download many modules from the module mirror, you will want to set
    the <code>Disable-Module-Fetch</code> header, described above.
  </p>

  <h2>Status: Launched</h2>
  <p>These services are ready for production use. Please
    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/new?title=proxy.golang.org:%20">file issues</a>
    if you spot them, with the title prefix "proxy.golang.org:" (or "index.golang.org:", or
    "sum.golang.org:").</p>

  <h2>Environment setup</h2>

  <p>These services can only access publicly available source code. If you depend on private
    modules, set <code>GOPRIVATE</code> to a glob pattern that covers them. See
    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Configuration_for_downloading_non_public_code">Module configuration for non-public modules</a>
    in the go command documentation for more details.</p>

  <p>To opt-out of this module mirror, you can turn it off by setting <code>GOPROXY=direct</code></p>

  <p>See the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#private-module-privacy">go command documentation</a>
    for other configuration details.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>I committed a new change (or released a new version) to a repository, why isn't it showing up
    when I run <code>go get -u</code> or <code>go list -m --versions</code>?</h3>
  <p>In order to improve our services' caching and serving latencies, new versions may not show up
    right away. If you want new code to be immediately available in the mirror, then first make sure
    there is a semantically versioned tag for this revision in the underlying source repository.
    Then explicitly request that version via <code>go get module@version</code>. The new version
    should be available within one minute. Note that if someone requested the version before the tag
    was pushed, it may take up to 30 minutes for the mirror's cache to expire and fresh data about
    the version to become available. If the version is still not available after 30 minutes, please
    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/new?title=proxy.golang.org%3A+">file an issue</a>.</p>

  <h3>I removed a bad release from my repository but it still appears in the mirror, what should I do?</h3>
  <p>Whenever possible, the mirror aims to cache content in order to avoid breaking builds for people
    that depend on your package, so this bad release may still be available in the mirror even if it
    is not available at the origin. The same situation applies if you delete your entire repository.
    We suggest creating a new version and encouraging people to use that one instead.</p>

  <p>If you would like to hide versions of a module from the <code>go</code>
    command, as well as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>, you should retract them.
    Retracting a module version involves adding a <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file-retract">retract directive</a>
    to your go.mod file and publishing a new version. See the Go blog post
    <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go116-module-changes#module-retraction">New module changes in Go 1.16</a> and
    the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-retract">modules reference</a> for details.</p>

  <h3>I'm running the go command in an environment that can't use the mirror.</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://golang.org/ref/mod#private-module-privacy">go command documentation</a>
    describes the configuration details including how to disable the use of these servers or use
    different ones.</p>

  <h3>If I don't set <code>GOPRIVATE</code> and request a private module from these services,
    what leaks?</h3>
  <p>The proxy and checksum database protocols only send module paths and versions to the remote
    server. If you request a private module, the mirror will try to download it just as any Go
    user would and fail in the same way. Information about failed requests isn't published
    anywhere. The only trace of the request will be in internal logs, which
    are governed by the <a href="privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

  <h3>Why did a previously available module become unavailable in the mirror?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://proxy.golang.org">proxy.golang.org</a> does not save all modules forever.
    There are a number of reasons for this, but one reason is if
    <a href="https://proxy.golang.org">proxy.golang.org</a> is not able to detect a suitable
    license. In this case, only a temporarily cached copy of the module will be made available, and
    may become unavailable if it is removed from the original source and becomes outdated.
    The checksums will still remain in the checksum database regardless of whether or not they
    have become unavailable in the mirror.</p>

  <h3>I have discovered a malicious module version in the mirror. Where do I report it?</h3>
  <p>Following <a href="https://golang.org/security#reporting">the security policy</a>, send an
    email to <a href="mailto:security@golang.org">security@golang.org</a> with the word
    "vulnerability" in the message somewhere.</p>
